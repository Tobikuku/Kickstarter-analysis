Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch date and goals by providing an analysis of outcomes based on goals and outcomes. The outcome based on goals analysis was filtered down to the “play” subcategory to show how the “plays” subcategory faired in general and the outcomes based on Launch Date was filtered down to the Theater category.

Overview of Analysis and Challenges

Theatre outcome based on launch dates.

The most successful launch month for the theatre parent category is May. May also has the most launch dates. According to our graph, projects launched in May were the most successful. The most failures also occurred in May; this may be because May had more launch dates than the other months. November had the least fails and May had the most fails however when looking at the percentages, 35% failed in November and 31.3% in May. The successes were 61% in November and 66.86% in May.



 



The Outcome Based on goals graph shows that the campaigns with the greatest successes are those less than a thousand dollars, they also had the least failures. 


Challenges I faced during this analysis were errors in entering formulas. The nuances were easy to miss for example the quotation marks in the Countifs and the commas caused errors. I had to review my formulas to ensure that I had the right information. 
 


Results

Theater Outcome Based on Launch Dates:

1.	May also has the most launch dates. According to our graph, projects launched in May were the most successful. The most failures also occurred in May; this may be because May had more launch dates than the other months. 
2.	November had the least fails and May had the most fails however when looking at the percentages, 35% failed in November and 31.3% in May. The successes were 61% in November and 66.86% in May.

Outcome Based on Goals

1.	The campaigns with the greatest successes are those less than a thousand dollars, they also had the least failures. 


Summary

I would recommend a graph of fever and a comparable play based on goals and month. I would also  compare by the years.
